This branch is an old version of SandPond that uses the TodeSplat language.<br>
I recommend that you go to the new version instead on the [main branch](https://github.com/l2wilson94/SandPond/tree/main).<br>
The new version uses the new SpaceTode language instead.<br>

You can still try out this old version at [todesplat.sandpond.cool](https://todesplat.sandpond.cool).<br>
You can still check out the [TodeSplat Documentation](https://github.com/l2wilson94/SandPond/wiki/%5BTodeSplat%5D-Documentation) on the [wiki](https://github.com/l2wilson94/SandPond/wiki/).<br>
Or check out the examples in the [Elements](https://github.com/l2wilson94/SandPond/tree/todesplat/Elements) folder.
